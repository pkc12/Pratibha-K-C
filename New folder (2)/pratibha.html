<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>
I find programming part interesting in IT. When I was doing programming language in my bachelor's in Business Administration as a part of curriculum, my desire to learn
more about programming language grew. I joined web designing cource and learnt HTML, CSS, Dreamweaver and Java Script there. Being in management field, i never found the programming language unintresting. For, IT is the growing field and have wide scope in careers, I can't be seperated from the aspects of IT despite of any profession I choose. Having completed my master's degree, I have decided to satisfy my interest in IT by doing diploma of information technology at RMIT. My knowledge about it will always help me to excel in my career. While doing research about the universities in open universities, I found RMIT attractive because of it's good student's support, student centric teaching, easily accessible resources and help, reasonable fees, good alumni success rates and so on. Throughout the journey at RMIT, I expect to develop an IT base of my knowledge to help prosper in my career no matter which profession i choose as IT is an integral part in all fields.

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>I like to play games so I look forward to develop a game that the gamers will love to play. In today’s world, kids and youngsters are so much fond of playing that they remain less connected to the real world and remain unsocial. I want to innovate such game which connects them to the real world, requires to use different location so that they don’t have to sit in one place, allows to make calls and texts while the game is in progress, develops the cognition of brain and so on. 
The game will be useful to make the children and youngsters connected and socialized. Allowing the calls and texts while playing will help them not to avoid peoples and important tasks. They can enjoy the game along with performing their daily routines. The location requirement will mobilize the users. Sitting in one place continuously affects the brain cognition, so requiring to move across different location avoids the potentiality of brain damage.
